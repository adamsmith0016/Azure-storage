## Comparing Local files with content of an Azure File Share:Compare__AZFILES_Local.py:

Is a script allowing you to compare the content of a local Directory(ex: “C:\Users\Desktop\test”(Windows) or home/someuser(Linux) etc..) to the content of an Azure File share, then returns the local files that NOT yet in the Azure File Share. In addition, you can also filter the results by using basic string-matching ex “text”.
